She sought the Sunstone, a relic said to restore magic to the land. Her only companion was a mischievous fox with a star-shaped birthmark on its ear, who seemed to know the forest's deepest secrets. As twilight fell, the woods grew silent, and the true test began. The fox led her to a clearing where a single, gnarled oak stood, its branches reaching for a moon that had long since vanished from the sky. It was here she realized the Sunstone wasn't a gem, but a song she had to sing to wake the moon.",
