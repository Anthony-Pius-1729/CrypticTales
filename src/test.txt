They sit in silence, the only sound the howling wind outside.
As the captain finishes his meager meal, he notices something on the table. 
A small, beautifully carved wooden box. 
He gestures towards it, his curiosity piqued.
The old man smiles and, with trembling hands, opens the box. 
Inside, on a bed of faded velvet, rests a single, perfectly preserved French porcelain doll.
The peasant explains that his daughter, who died years ago, adored this doll. 
A French soldier, a good man, he says, had given it to her during the previous war, decades ago.
It was a small act of kindness in a time of great cruelty. 
The peasant had kept it all these years, a testament to a fleeting moment of humanity.
